**Subject**: H5HG_READ Segmentation Fault in HDF5 V1.14.0

**Software**: HDF5 V1.14.0
**Operating System**: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS
**Compiler**: clang

**Build Process**: 
The software was built using the following steps and options:

```bash
 ./configure --disable-shared --enable-static-exec && make
```
No additional build options were required beyond the default ones provided.

**Test Procedure**: 
The following command was used for the test:
```bash
tools/src/h5diff plain_model.h5 {id:crash_file}
```
The file `plain_model.h5` is available within the provided package located [here](https://github.com/sascha47/H5HG_read-at-H5HG.c/raw/main/poc.zip).

**Observation**:
During the execution of the aforementioned command, a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) was observed. The stack trace for the segmentation fault is as follows:

```bash
Starting program: /root/hdf5-1.14.0/tools/src/h5diff/h5diff /root/hdf5-1.14.0/in/plain_model.h5 /root/hdf5-1.14.0/out/fuzz00/crashes/id:000025,sig:11,src:000000,op:flip1,pos:3977
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

```

Note: For corpus and "in" file, only the `plain_model.h5` file was utilized. However, both files can be used for the `$BASE_MODEL`.
